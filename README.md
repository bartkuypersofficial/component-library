## 📋 Approach

### Documentation & Languages
All documentation is in English to ensure clarity across different developers and teams.

### Project Structure
The `src` folder uses numbered organization (tokens → components → assets) for logical progression and maintainability.
I spent more time on this project than the suggested 60–90 minutes, mainly because I enjoyed the assignment and wanted to challenge myself at certain levels rather than taking the simplest and easiest route. I notice that I spend extra time when I don’t work from a design, in this case, I worked from an idea in my head and developed it from there.

### Development Methodology
- **CSS Architecture:** SMACSS methodology for clean, organized styles
- **Naming Convention:** BEM for component naming
- **Build Tool:** Vite for local development server
- **Version Control:** Git commits follow release/hotfix structure

### Design Decisions

**Vite**
I set up a simple Vite installation so that I could run the project via a local server and have the scripting work as I envisioned. My Git commits follow a structure where I use release for new code and hotfix for fine-tuning and problem-solving.

**Component Organization:**
Currently components are in a single folder. Future improvements would implement Atomic Design (atoms, molecules, organisms) for scalability.

**Responsive Design:**
- Navigation controls visible on screens **>1024px** (desktop viewports)
- Reusable components designed for flexible grid layouts
- Product cards span full width but adapt to 2, 3, 4+ column grids

**Tools & Assistance:**
GitHub Copilot provided foundational HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code adapted to project standards.

### CMS Experience
I have experience with various CMS systems and adapt quickly when working with them. Currently, I work with Umbraco, so I haven’t used WordPress in a while. However, from experience, I know that I can quickly find my way around such CMS projects once I start working with them, and I am confident that I will quickly get up to speed with WordPress and Bricks.
